# pharmacy-supply


Pharmacy Supply Management project created in Java.

This is Rest-API based project in which there are certain microservices written in Java which are working independently to share resources with each other.
Each microservice is doing its own task.
Each Microservice will register itself to Eureka Server, which will help in dynamic routing.
